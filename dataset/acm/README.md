# ACM Dataset Description

We extract papers published in KDD, SIGMOD, SIGCOMM, MobiCOMM, and VLDB and divide the papers into three classes (*Database, Wireless Communication, Data Mining*). Then we construct a heterogeneous graph that comprises 4019 papers (P), 7167 authors (A) and 60 subjects (S). 

| Relation（A-B） | Number of A | Number of B | Number of A-B |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Paper-author    | 4019        | 7167        | 13407         |
| Paper-subject   | 4019        | 60          | 4019          |
